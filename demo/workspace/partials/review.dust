		<p>Terrific performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto elevate this socio-medical drama out of the realms of the ordinary into something quietly remarkable. While McConaughey's dramatic weight loss may make attention-grabbing headlines, there's much more to his performance than the mere shedding of 30-odd pounds. Continuing the reinvention (dubbed the "McConaissance") which has seen him lay the ghost of grizzly romcoms such as Failure to Launch with harder-edged roles in Magic Mike and Killer Joe, McConaughey is utterly convincing as the ravaged rodeo redneck who is given 30 days to live after being diagnosed with Aids, but who stubbornly refuses to lie down and die. Despite very strong competition from Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave, odds are that McConaughey will take the Oscar for best actor next month, with Leto similarly triumphing with best supporting actor. Both wins would be thoroughly deserved.</p>
		<p>Crucially, Woodroof's motives were anything but charitable. As played by McConaughey, Ron is a dyed in the wool homophobe and misogynist who believes only "fags" get Aids, and whose first response to his diagnosis is furious macho denial. It is sheer survival instinct that drives Ron across the border to track down alternative medication, and it is hard financial gain that inspires him to run drugs back into the US for sale to the sick and vulnerable. Similarly, Ron's relationship with pre-op transgender Aids patient Rayon – a composite character into whom Leto breathes tender life and soul – is entirely opportunistic; a committed bigot, Woodroof needs a way into the gay community and Rayon is his passport to monetary reward. Only later, when business is booming, does something approaching friendship emerge – in the beginning, it's strictly business.</p>
