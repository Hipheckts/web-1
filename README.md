rosecomb
========

Templating layer concept for Bantam. Node.


### Install

	npm install

### Run

	node index.js

Rosecomb is currently hardcoded to run on port 8081, and expects the Serama API to be running locally on port 8888. These two settings need to be moved into a configuration block.

### How it works

The `workspace` directory contains the pages, partials and datasources required to display data retrieved from the Serama API.

Each page is defined in a JSON file specifying the datasources that will retrieve the data for display.

A datasource is a JSON file specifying the API endpoint to connect to along with parameters to use when querying the API.

### Example

If a request is made to Rosecomb running on `http://localhost:8081/articles` the application takes the `articles` parameter and looks for an `articles.json` page descriptor in `workspace/pages`. Any datasources that page descriptor specifies are loaded from `workspace/data-sources` and the data is retrieved from the datasource's API endpoint. In order to render the returned data to the browser, a Dust template must exist in `workspace/pages` with the same name as the requested page, e.g. `articles.dust`.
